            <p>Welcome to Regent Thai Massage & Spa! Immerse yourself in the authentic healing art of Traditional Thai Massage, where centuries-old techniques from Buriram, Thailand combine with expert touch to restore balance and vitality to your body and mind.</p>
            <p>In your session, our skilled therapist uses time-honoured techniques including compression, pulling, stretching, and rocking, prioritising metta (loving-kindness) from Buddhist teachings. Performed fully clothed on traditional floor mats, this dynamic treatment effectively alleviates muscle pain, soreness, and back pain through targeted exercises, stretching, and pressure point manipulation, promoting improved blood flow and relieving tight muscle spots.</p>
            <p>Our Traditional Thai Massage is perfect for those seeking a holistic approach to wellness. Often described as 'passive yoga', this treatment helps improve flexibility, relieve muscle tension, and boost energy levels. Whether you're dealing with specific areas of tension, seeking to improve your range of motion, or looking to maintain overall wellness, this authentic Thai massage experience offers profound benefits for body and spirit.</p>
