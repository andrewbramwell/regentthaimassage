                    I have had quite a few Thai massages in Cheltenham and this was head and shoulders above the rest. I think it may be the best massage I have ever had. It was totally authentic and left me feeling rejuvenated. Maya was very professional and knew exactly what she was doing. The spa was very clean and attractively decorated. if you want a real Thai massage, this is the place to go. I will certainly be returning.

                    I visited Regent Thai Massage with my FiancÃ©e for a couples massage and staff were very friendly and professional, I felt so relaxed that I fell asleep and my wife even said I was snoring ðŸ˜‚.

                    Had a very authentic Thai massage this week. Very welcoming staff. Great massage at a great price. Will definitely be going back. Will make sure I have enough time to enjoy the complimentary tea next time.
